# Predicting Carbon Emissions in Rwanda

## Overview
This repository contains code and resources for the Kaggle competition on predicting carbon emissions in Rwanda using open-source emissions data from Sentinel-5P satellite observations. The challenge is to build machine learning models that accurately predict CO2 emissions for the year 2022 through November based on data from 2019 to 2021.

## Dataset
The dataset consists of approximately 497 unique locations across Rwanda, covering farm lands, cities, and power plants. The data is split by time, with training data containing information from 2019 to 2021, and the task is to predict CO2 emissions for 2022 through November.

### Features
Seven main features were extracted weekly from Sentinel-5P, including:

1. Sulphur Dioxide 
2. Carbon Monoxide 
3. Nitrogen Dioxide 
4. Formaldehyde 
5. UV Aerosol Index 
6. Ozone 
7. Cloud
8. Emission

Each feature includes sub-features, such as `column_number_density`, representing the vertical column density at ground level, calculated using the Differential Optical Absorption Spectroscopy (DOAS) technique.

## Files
- `train.csv`: The training set [Link ](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/playground-series-s3e20/data?select=train.csv)
- `test.csv`: The test set; the task is to predict the emission target for each week at each location [Link ](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/playground-series-s3e20/data?select=test.csv)

### Best Performing Models
1. **Random Forest:** The Random Forest model exhibits the lowest error, suggesting it provides the most accurate predictions among the models tested.

2. **Decision Trees:** Decision Trees also perform well, with a relatively low error compared to other models.

3. **XGBoost:** XGBoost, while not as accurate as Random Forest, still demonstrates good performance with a moderate error.

### Models to Investigate
1. **Gradient Boosting Machines (GBM):** The GBM model shows a higher error compared to Random Forest, indicating potential areas for improvement or optimization.

2. **Support Vector Machines (SVM):** SVM has a significantly higher error, suggesting it may not be well-suited for this specific task or may require additional tuning.

3. **Linear Regression:** Linear Regression exhibits a high error, indicating that the relationship between features and emissions may not be adequately captured by a linear model.

## Next Steps
1. **Model Tuning:** Explore hyperparameter tuning for the models, especially Gradient Boosting Machines and Support Vector Machines, to potentially improve performance.

2. **Feature Engineering:** Experiment with feature engineering techniques to enhance the predictive power of the models.

3. **Ensemble Methods:** Consider ensemble methods, such as stacking or blending, to combine the strengths of multiple models for improved accuracy.

4. **Data Analysis:** Conduct a detailed analysis of feature importance to understand the factors influencing the model predictions.

5. **Validation Strategies:** Evaluate the models using different validation strategies to ensure robustness and reliability.
